# Spike Auto-generating Postman Collections

Short spike to see how to manually create Postman collections and environments off OpenAPI specs.

## Running

Best to check `package.json`.

```s
# Install and run
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If you have the API keys, uncomment. If you don't, you can drag and drop the exported files into Postman imports.
